        Local mean time (LMT) is a form of solar time that corrects the
        variations of local apparent time, forming a uniform time scale at a
        specific longitude. This measurement of time was used for everyday use
        during the 19th century before time zones were introduced beginning in
        the late 19th century; it still has some uses in astronomy and
        navigation.
